# data-structures
Implementation of various data strucutres in C++:
- ArrayDeque
- LinkedDeque
- BinarySearchTree
- AVLTree

I also have added an exercise, TransactionManager, to check the performance of each BST and AVL tree.

Comment - I coded them during my university course, so the comments included are in the language in which it was taught, Catalan.
